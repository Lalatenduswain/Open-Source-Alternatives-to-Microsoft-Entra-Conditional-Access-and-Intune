# Open Source Alternatives to Microsoft Entra Conditional Access and Intune

## 1. Executive Summary

Microsoft Entra Conditional Access and Intune are enterprise-grade tools for identity and access management (IAM) and endpoint device management, offering features like single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), domain-based access control, endpoint configuration, and data loss prevention (DLP). However, their subscription costs, complexity, and vendor lock-in can be prohibitive for small-to-mid-sized businesses (SMBs). This document outlines open-source alternatives that replicate key functionalities of Entra and Intune, tailored for DevOps, SysAdmins, and security engineers. By combining tools like Keycloak, Authelia, Authentik, Wazuh, FleetDM, Osquery, Rudder, pfSense, and Pi-hole, organizations can achieve robust IAM and endpoint management at a lower cost with greater customization and control. The document includes architecture diagrams, implementation considerations, and practical use cases to guide deployment.

## 2. Problem Statement

SMBs often seek alternatives to Microsoft Entra and Intune due to:

- **Cost**: Subscription fees for Microsoft 365 and associated services can strain budgets.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Proprietary ecosystems limit flexibility and increase dependency.
- **Customization Needs**: Open-source solutions offer greater control over configurations and integrations.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Self-hosted solutions ensure sensitive data remains under organizational control.
- **Scalability**: SMBs need lightweight, scalable tools that align with lean IT resources.

Open-source alternatives provide cost-effective, auditable, and customizable solutions, though they require technical expertise for setup and maintenance.

## 3. Authentication and Conditional Access Tools

### A. Keycloak
- **Overview**: Keycloak, developed by Red Hat, is a mature open-source IAM solution under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It supports enterprise-grade SSO, MFA, and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **Features**:
  - Protocols: OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), SAML 2.0.
  - MFA: Supports TOTP, WebAuthn, and hardware tokens (e.g., YubiKey).

## 6. Detailed Architecture Diagrams and Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. **User Request**: User attempts to access an internal service (e.g., web app).
2. **Reverse Proxy**: NGINX/Traefik forwards the request to Keycloak/Authentik/Authelia.
3. **Authentication**: User authenticates with MFA and domain-based restrictions.
4. **Policy Check**: OPA evaluates conditional access policies (e.g., device compliance).
5. **Access Granted/Denied**: Service access is granted based on policy compliance.

    A[User] -->|HTTP Request| B[NGINX/Traefik]
    B -->|Forward Auth| C[Keycloak/Authentik/Authelia]

    D -->|Policy Decision| E{Access Granted?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Internal Service]
    E -->|No| G[Access Denied]
```

### Endpoint Monitoring Flow
1. **Endpoint Agent**: Wazuh/Osquery agents collect system data.
2. **Central Server**: Data is sent to Wazuh/FleetDM for analysis.
3. **Policy Enforcement**: Rudder pushes compliance policies.
4. **Alerting**: Unauthorized activity triggers Slack/email alerts.

```

## 7. Implementation Considerations and Limitations

- **Setup Complexity**: Open-source tools require technical expertise for deployment and maintenance compared to Microsoft’s managed services.
- **Scalability**: Keycloak and Wazuh scale well but may need additional resources for large deployments.
- **Feature Parity**: Full replication of Entra’s conditional access or Intune’s mobile device management (MDM) is challenging; focus on core needs (e.g., SSO, app control).
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates and security patches are critical; allocate IT resources accordingly.
- **Integration**: Tools like OPA require custom policy development, increasing setup time.
- **Limitations**:
  - Authelia lacks native social login support.
  - FleetDM/Osquery may not fully replace Intune’s MDM for mobile devices.
  - DNS filtering (Pi-hole/pfSense) can be bypassed by savvy users.

**Practical Tip**: Use container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) for scalable deployments and automate updates with CI/CD pipelines.

  - Add Microsoft consumer domains (e.g., `outlook.live.com`, `onedrive.live.com`) to Pi-hole/pfSense blacklists.
  - Set Wazuh rules to trigger Slack alerts on detection.
- **Example Rule (Wazuh)**:
  ```xml
  <rule id="100001" level="12">
    <if_sid>53000</if_sid>
    <url>login.live.com</url>
    <description>Attempted access to personal Microsoft account</description>
    <action>alert_slack</action>
  </rule>
  ```
- **Outcome**: Prevents data leaks to personal Microsoft accounts.

### B. Enforcing MFA

- **Setup**:
  - Configure Keycloak/Authentik to require TOTP for all users.
  - Integrate with NGINX/Traefik for service access.
  - Example (Keycloak): Set MFA as a required action in the authentication flow.
- **Outcome**: Ensures secure access to internal services.

## 10. Conclusion and Practical Recommendations

While open-source tools cannot fully replicate the seamless integration of Microsoft Entra and Intune, a combination of Keycloak/Authentik/Authelia for IAM, Wazuh/FleetDM/Rudder for endpoint management, and pfSense/Pi-hole for DNS filtering offers a robust, cost-effective alternative for SMBs. **Recommendations**:
- **Start Small**: Deploy Keycloak and Wazuh for core IAM and monitoring.
- **Automate**: Use Docker/Kubernetes for deployment and Ansible for configuration management.
- **Monitor**: Set up alerting (e.g., Slack) for real-time incident response.
- **Test**: Validate policies in a staging environment to avoid production issues.
- **Community Support**: Leverage GitHub and Discord communities for Keycloak, Authentik, and Wazuh.

This architecture empowers SMBs with auditable, customizable security while avoiding vendor lock-in. For advanced setups, consider integrating a Git repository for managing FleetDM queries or Keycloak realms.
